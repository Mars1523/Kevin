The robot code for MARS 1523 robot Kevin for the 2019 season

This branch of the code contains a large amount of comments explaining various 
details of the code, why certain things are written the way they are, and hopefully
contains enough explanation to give a through understanding of a "real" robot.

To get started, first check out [`robot/robot.py`](robot/robot.py), 
this file is where each piece of the robot is set up.
Then, check out [`robot/controls/primary.py`](robot/controls/primary.py), 
this is the file that actually explains _what_ the robot should do. It takes the
control inputs and makes the parts of the robot do things.
Every other file just sets up parts and defines _how_ to do things.
